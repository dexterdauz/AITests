Basic Principle. A major purpose of the Privacy Rule is to define and limit the
circumstances in which an individual’s protected heath information may be used or
disclosed by covered entities. A covered entity may not use or disclose protected
health information, except either: (1) as the Privacy Rule permits or requires; or (2) as
the individual who is the subject of the information (or the individual’s personal
representative) authorizes in writing.16
Required Disclosures. A covered entity must disclose protected health information
in only two situations: (a) to individuals (or their personal representatives)
specifically when they request access to, or an accounting of disclosures of, their
protected health information; and (b) to HHS when it is undertaking a compliance
investigation or review or enforcement action.17 See OCR “Government Access”
Guidance.
